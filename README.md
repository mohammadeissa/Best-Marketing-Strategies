📊 Marketing Data Analysis in C++
Efficient ROI & Conversion Rate Optimization Using Custom Data Structures

🛠 Project Overview
This project analyzes marketing campaign performance by calculating key metrics like ROI (Return on Investment) and Conversion Rates. Built entirely in C++, it efficiently processes large datasets using optimized data structures, providing valuable insights into campaign effectiveness.

💡 Key Features
✔️ Data Parsing & Storage – Reads structured marketing data from files and efficiently stores it.
✔️ Custom Data Structures – Implements Binary Search Trees (BSTs), Queues, Linked Lists, and Arrays for efficient data management.
✔️ Statistical Analysis – Computes ROI, Conversion Rates, Cost per Acquisition (CPA), and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
✔️ Performance Comparison – Analyzes and compares different marketing strategies across channels.
✔️ Correlation Analysis – Identifies relationships between marketing spend and customer engagement.
✔️ CLI-Based Report Generation – Outputs summary insights and performance metrics in a structured format.

🔢 Data Structures Used
✅ Binary Search Tree (BST) – Stores and retrieves marketing performance data efficiently.
✅ Queue – Manages processing of incoming campaign data.
✅ Linked List – Handles dynamic storage of customer engagement metrics.
✅ Array – Stores and processes raw numerical datasets for computation.

📂 Dataset Details
Fields: Campaign types, target demographics, channels used, marketing spend, engagement metrics.
Processing Goal: Identify top-performing strategies and optimize future campaign decisions.
🚀 How It Works
Load the dataset into the appropriate data structures.
Process the data to compute ROI, Conversion Rates, and CPA.
Analyze trends using statistical and correlation techniques.
Generate a summary report to help businesses optimize marketing efforts.
